# Rust Mini Projects

Wanted to learn some rust, here are some mini projects.


## To Run

Please first install Rust, then do cargo run inside the directory.

```bash
cargo run
```


## Projects

- Array-Error
    - Read from an index or get an error
- Control_Flow
    - Basic control flow for rust, uses functions, loops, counters, etc
- Fibonnaci to N
    - Counts to N in Fibonnaci in rust :) I just wanted to see how fast rust really is!
- fun-Proj
    - Hello, World! Sorry, not very fun. But Rust is!
- function func
    - Having fun with functions in Rust! 
- guessing game
    - Guess what the number is, you have a couple of tries. Num is 1..=100, and uses rnd, and cmp
- hello-rust
    - Rust's first Hello Rust program (and my own!) Prints Hello Fellow Rustaceans!
- one million counter
    - Counts to 1 million and times it. I just wanted to see how fast it could count vs python, C# using .NET console app, and JS. (All of which not included and rust got 3rd place after the 2nd compile for C# which won... Interesting huh?) 
- sample-proj
    - Arrays, Tuples, Data Structures!
